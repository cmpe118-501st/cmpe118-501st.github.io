			<p> Although the midterm had depleated and taken the lives and grades of many the war and beer challenge rage on. A few of the most elite student had banded together paying tribute to the 501st Legion of the clone wars. Often referred to as Gabe's Fist, Ian Zentner, Josh Gutterman, and Victor Ardulov of UC Santa Cruz's Computer Engineering 118 class have begun the process of building and deploying a robot that will be competing at a gladiator match publicalily demoed to the people of Cruz-o-bah on Dec 4, 2015. This site is here to help us document our progress, and allow us to keep everyone else interested in oure project aware of what's going on. So buckle up as we go 0 to 66 in 5 weeks, with little sleep, caffeine induced emotional break downs, and one really dedicated team that just wants to go home for Thanksgiving...</p>
